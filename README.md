Decentralized Crowdfunding Platform
The Decentralized Crowdfunding Platform is a smart contract-based solution that transforms the traditional fundraising process by eliminating middlemen and leveraging the transparency, security, and immutability of blockchain technology.

This platform allows project creators (campaign owners) to launch funding campaigns with a specified goal amount and deadline. Contributors (users) can send Ether (ETH) to support the campaign during its active period.

üîê Trustless Fund Management
The core functionality is governed by a smart contract, which ensures that:

If the goal is met before the deadline, the campaign owner can withdraw the collected funds.

If the goal is not met by the deadline, all contributors can claim refunds, and the project owner cannot access the funds.

This removes the need for trust between campaign creators and supporters‚Äîrules are enforced automatically on-chain.

üîé Transparency & Security
Every transaction is recorded on the blockchain, making contributions fully traceable and tamper-proof. This prevents fraud and misuse of funds, which are common issues in centralized crowdfunding platforms.

‚öôÔ∏è Key Functions
contribute(): Allows users to send funds to a campaign.

withdraw(): Lets the campaign owner claim funds only if the goal is reached.

refund(): Allows contributors to get their money back if the campaign fails.
